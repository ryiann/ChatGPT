## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in the project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/ChatGPT-Next-Web/security/advisories/new) section of the repository.

2. Provide a clear and detailed description of the vulnerability, including any steps to reproduce it.

3. Submit the issue.

Once you've reported a vulnerability, I will examine it and respond appropriately. Also, if you're able to decrypt artifacts from [here](https://github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/ChatGPT-Next-Web/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) such as vulnerabilities (eg exploit) and identify any vulnerabilities, that would be highly appreciated.
